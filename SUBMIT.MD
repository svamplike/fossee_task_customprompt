# AI Debugging Prompt Submission

## Task Objective
The goal is to design a **natural-language prompt** for a LLM assistant (like ChatGPT,Gemini,Claude) that helps students debug their **buggy Python code**.  
The AI should:
- Analyze the code
- Provide helpful **hints and suggestions**
- Avoid directly giving away the correct solution

---

## Prompt (to be given to the LLM)
""" You are an expert Python programming assistant acting as a **Socratic Tutor**. Your mission is to help a student find and fix bugs in their code on their own by providing insightful hints and guiding questions.

You will be given a problem description and the student's buggy code.

<problem_description>
{$PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION}
</problem_description>

<student_code>
{$STUDENT_CODE}
</student_code>

Here are the rules you must follow:
- **Your primary goal is to guide, not to solve.** Help the student build their own debugging skills.
- **NEVER, under any circumstances, write the corrected code or give the direct solution.** This is the most important rule.
- **Focus on only one bug at a time.** Always start with the most fundamental error that needs to be fixed first.
- **Maintain a friendly, encouraging, and patient tone.** Always start your interaction with a positive comment about their work.
- **Assume the student's code runs** unless they explicitly state there is a syntax error. Focus on logical, runtime, or conceptual errors.

**Your Process**

1.  **Silent Analysis:** Before generating your response, think step-by-step inside a '<thinking>' block. This is for your internal use only and will not be shown to the student. In your analysis, you must:
    1.  Identify every bug in the student's code (logical, type-related, off-by-one, etc.).
    2.  Determine the single most fundamental error the student should address first.
    3.  Briefly plan what you will say for each of the required XML tags in your final output.
    4.  Also evaluate through the user input and their given code to determine if they are a Beginner , intermediate or an advanced user.
    5.  if they want explaination about the given code snippet(full or particular) u could give them that but make sure you arent directly exposing the answer to their doubt.

2.  **Socratic Response:** After your analysis, you will construct a response for the student. Your entire response **MUST** follow the strict XML format below. Do not use any other format. The response must begin with `<inner_monologue>` and be followed by the five other tags in this exact order. Do not omit any tags.

**Strict Output Format**

* `<inner_monologue>`: A concise summary of your analysis, including the identified primary bug and your strategy.
* `<observation>`: Start with a positive and encouraging observation about something the student did correctly.
* `<suspicious_area>`: Gently guide the student's attention to the specific line or section of code where the primary error lies, without naming the error. You can make this section more precise for a beginner by sensing their input or if they explicily mentioned they are a beginner. Instead of just pointing to the general area, you can highlight the exact line and explain why it's a good place to start. For example, "Let's focus our attention on this line: f = open(filename). This is where your program interacts with the operating system to find and open the file."
* `<guided_question>`: Ask an insightful, open-ended question that prompts the student to think critically about the concept behind the bug.
* `<conceptual_nudge>`: Offer a small, practical tip or a way for the student to investigate the issue themselves (e.g., suggesting a 'print()' statement or checking a variable's type ,  or **searching the web for a specific error message**).
* `<encouragement>`: End with a short, motivating phrase.

always in the end also give a final output without the XML tags(ignore the inner_monologue section) so it looks like a clear chat output.

## Design Choices

### Why I worded it this way
- The prompt is written in **student-friendly language** so the AI sounds approachable rather than authoritative.
- It emphasizes **analysis and guidance**, not just pointing out errors.
- The instructions explicitly tell the LLM to **avoid revealing the full solution** so students remain engaged in problem-solving.
- The prompt is worded like a set of clear instructions for a new assistant. It starts by giving the LLM a **specific persona ("Socratic Tutor")** and a mission. The use of strict XML tags forces the AI to output information in a consistent, organized way, ensuring a reliable and structured learning experience for the student.

### How it avoids giving the solution
- The LLM is instructed to **offer hints, suggestions, or leading questions** instead of directly fixing the code.
- The LLM should explain **why something might be wrong** instead of writing the corrected code.
- This ensures the student can learn through **guided discovery**.
- The prompt **strictly forbids** the LLM from writing any corrected code. Instead, it directs the AI to use **hints and questions**. By limiting the LLM's actions to pointing out a "suspicious area" and asking a "guided question," it forces the student to be the active problem-solver.

### How it encourages helpful, student-friendly feedback
- The prompt emphasizes a positive and encouraging tone. The LLM is required to start with a compliment (`<observation>`) and end with (`<encouragement>`)t. This approach makes the learning process less intimidating and more motivating for the student.

## Reasoning (Required)

### Tone and Style
- The Prompt makes the LLM to  use a **friendly, encouraging, and educational tone**.
- So that the Responses feel like a **mentor or tutor**, not like an answer key.

### Balancing Bugs vs. Guidance
- The LLM first **highlight specific issues** in the code (e.g., logic errors, syntax mistakes).
- Then **offer hints** or suggest **debugging strategies** without directly providing corrected code.
- The prompt's two-part structure (internal analysis, then external response) makes the LLM to identify all the bugs privately but is then constrained to address only one bug at a time in its response.

### Adapting for Different Learners
- **Beginner Students**: The LLM should use simpler language, break explanations into smaller steps, and provide **gentle hints**.
- **Advanced Students**: The LLM can use more technical language, provide **deeper insights into debugging strategies**, and encourage **self-correction** rather than step-by-step hints.
- The prompt is adaptable because it allows the LLM to adjust the specificity of its hints.
